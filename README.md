## Features

## Student Record Management
	-       Add students with validated 7-digit unique IDs.
	-	Store names and grades for 5 subjects.
	-	Automatic GPA calculation upon entry.

## Search & Update
	â€¢	Search student data by ID.
	â€¢	Update grades and GPA by ID or name.

ðŸ“‚ Data Persistence
	â€¢	Save/load records using structured CSV files.
	â€¢	Auto-handling of headers and formatting.

ðŸ”ƒ Sorting
	â€¢	Sort student list by:
	â€¢	ID
	â€¢	Name
	â€¢	GPA
	â€¢	Efficient in-place QuickSort on a linked list.

ðŸ“Š Visualization
	â€¢	Bar chart for:
	â€¢	GPA distribution of all students.
	â€¢	Subject-wise grades of a selected student.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
	â€¢	Language: C
	â€¢	Data Structures: Structs, Arrays, Linked Lists
	â€¢	File Handling: CSV Read/Write
	â€¢	Sorting: Recursive QuickSort (in-place)
	â€¢	Memory Management: malloc, free with Valgrind validation

ðŸš€ How to Compile & Run
	1.	Ensure main.c, student.c, and student.h are in the same directory.
	2.	Compile using:

gcc main.c student.c -o output


	3.	Run the progom

./output

ðŸ“‹ Menu Options
	1.	Add a Student
	2.	Display All Students
	3.	Save and Exit
	4.	Sort Students (by ID / Name / GPA)
	5.	Search for a Student
	6.	Print GPA Bar Chart
	7.	Update GPA â€“ by ID
	8.	Update GPA â€“ by Name
	9.	Remove a Student

â¸»

âœ… Input Validation
	â€¢	Valid 7-digit unique Student IDs
	â€¢	Grades must be between 0 and 100
	â€¢	No duplicate entries allowed

â¸»

ðŸ§ª Testing & Debugging
	â€¢	Edge Cases:
	â€¢	Empty records
	â€¢	Corrupted CSV files
	â€¢	GPA on boundary grades
	â€¢	Memory:
	â€¢	Verified with Valgrind to ensure no leaks

â¸»

ðŸ§  Challenges & Lessons Learned
	â€¢	Implementing QuickSort for linked lists
	â€¢	Managing dynamic memory and avoiding leaks
	â€¢	Parsing edge cases in CSV files

â¸»

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
	â€¢	GUI or Web-based interface
	â€¢	Error recovery for corrupted files
	â€¢	User roles and login systems
	â€¢	Data encryption for privacy
